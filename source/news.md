**The Dataverse Sustainability Working Group is Launched!**
The Dataverse community is growing rapidly. Earlier this year, installation no. 100 was added to the “official” list of [Dataverse Installations Around the World](https://dataverse.org/installations). The Dataverse software is chosen by an increasing number of organizations across the globe as the technical backbone of their Trusted Digital Repository for research data.

**The Global Dataverse Community Consortium (GDCC)** recognized that with this growth and popularity comes the responsibility of ensuring the long-term sustainability of the software and the community. That’s why we have initiated the **Dataverse Sustainability Working Group (WG)**. The WG had its kick-off meeting on September 5, where the WG Charter was approved and **Dieuwertje Bloemen** from KU Leuven (Belgia) and **Rene Belsø** from DeiC (Denmark) were elected as WG Chairs. They will also serve as the points of contact for the WG.

The mission of the working group is to provide **evidence-based, community-reviewed, and consensus-based recommendations on how to empower the global Dataverse community to sustain the Dataverse software and the strength of the Dataverse community**.

The working group will map out the needs and challenges of the community. Based on this mapping, the WG will deliver recommendations in the form of a report(s), addressing the following issues:
- **Mission and vision:** What purpose should the community have? What should the community envision to achieve in the next 5-10 years?
- **Strategic objectives:** What objectives should the community have to carry out its mission and to achieve its vision?
- **Means and resources:** What means and resources should the community use to achieve its strategic objectives?
- **Implementation:** What plan and roadmap should the community have to achieve its objectives?

Expected timeline:
- August 2023: Working Group established
- September 2023: First meeting
- February 2023: Status report to the GDCC Steering Committee
- March 2024: Working Group presents options and scenarios to the community at the Dataverse Community Meeting 2024
- June 2024: Final report with recommendations to the GDCC Steering Committee

For more details and information on the working group, please reach out to the co-chairs Dieuwertje Bloemen (dieuwertje.bloemen@kuleuven.be) and Rene Belso (rene.belso@deic.dk).
